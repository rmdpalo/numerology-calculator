The prerequisites for the project are as follows:

### Project Objectives:
- Build a terminal program using Python
- Add at least one interactive feature using input()
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Write a technical blog post on the project

### Prerequisites:
- Python
- Git/GitHub
- Command Line and File Navigation

## Technical Blog Post:

For my final project for this course, I decided to create a Numerology Destiny Number Calculator. 
I chose this because my friends and I recently talked about numerology and tried figuring out our "Destiny Numbers" for fun. However, calculating this number manually at times becomes a bit much especially for people with long birth names like myself. So what better way to wrap up CS101 than solving a relevant (though small) problem my friends and I were facing?

### Destiny number summary

There are several ways to calculate this number but basically you would take your full birth name and convert it into numbers on this chart. 
Next, you would sum up all these numbers until you are either left with a single digit 1-9 or a *Master Number* (11, 22, 33, 44, 55). Then you can use that number to discern the energy that you attract from others and the world.

Remember this is just all in good fun :)

### Obstacles faced

- *OS differences* - While working on this project I faced several technical issues. It mainly had to do with the OS that I was working with, in my previous bootcamp years ago and in my work I usually use MacOS. But for this project (and course overall), I wanted to use Windows OS. 
- *Git/Github* - Initial set up of git and my github repo was a bit tedious having to add environment variables to my PATH. But once we got past that most issues I faced were with CLI command differences between the two OS's (i.e. 'li' for mac/linux and 'dir')
- *Python installation* - Mac streamlines the process of installing python by the use of homebrew, but for windows the default install took me to the Microsoft store and installing through there. But doing that my code editor (VS Code) did not recognize my Python installation as an interpreter, I had to uninstall and reinstall through Python's official website and making sure to check the option to add it to PATH during installation.

Aside from the obstacles listed above, working in Python and Windows OS is an awesome change of pace and keeps me on my toes.
